# CV Landmarks
A simple application of face detection using Dlib with facial landmarks. Notice you should change the parameters when running the script to define the target image and the landmark trained model file. You can find an example below.

There is one script for using an image to locate the landmarks while the other uses the camera. They are named appropriately.
